//! Open spend-slot directory and the sequential page log behind `spent.body`.

//! Confirm records 8-byte slots here, including a short tail page. Each dirty
//! page is composed into one image. A checkpoint rewrites `spend.pages` to the
//! images still named and renames `spend.pages.commit` before `spend_durable`
//! advances. The directory keeps that file's offset, not a second copy of the
//! image. A covered slot, including an explicit zero, is read from the file.
//! A slot past a short image stays on `spent.body`. Fold copies the file bytes
//! onto `spent.body` after that marker, starting at byte 16 on page 0 so the
//! file header stays put. A commit that names bytes refuses a missing or short
//! image, including `spend.pages.{generation}` left when a crash lands between
//! the commit rename and the pages rename.
