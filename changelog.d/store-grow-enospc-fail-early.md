Fixed

- **A full disk fails the store grow on Linux, not a later page write.** When
  Linux `fallocate` returns ENOSPC or EDQUOT, the file grow used to fall back
  to a sparse `set_len` and report success, so the out-of-space error surfaced
  on a later page write, possibly in the middle of a scripthash rewrite that
  had already released its old pages. The grow now returns the error at the
  allocation, before any caller frees or overwrites anything. A failed grow
  leaves the file length and the recorded capacity unchanged, including when
  `fallocate` had already extended the file. When the doubled or headroom size
  does not fit but the size the caller needs does, the grow succeeds at that
  smaller size. A signal-interrupted `fallocate` is retried.

  Known limit: only EOPNOTSUPP, ENOSYS and EINVAL (and platforms without
  `fallocate`: macOS and Windows) still extend the file sparsely. There a full
  disk can still show up on a later page write. A tail left sparse by an
  earlier version also stays writable after `open`.
