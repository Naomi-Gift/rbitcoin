Fixed

- **A new block no longer stalls Electrum and Esplora while peers are told
  about it.** Deciding how to announce a tip to each peer read every parent
  by rebuilding that whole block from the archive, up to about 128 blocks
  per peer, on the same workers that answer Electrum and Esplora. It now
  reads each parent from the stored header. Electrum tip notifications and
  block requests right after a new tip no longer wait hundreds of
  milliseconds.
