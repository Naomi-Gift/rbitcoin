Changed

- **Core's tests run from Bitcoin Core master `d206226b`, after v32.1.**
  The consensus suites gain the vectors Core added since v32.1, including
  bitcoin/bitcoin#36458's interpreter edges (CSV with -2, IFDUP on negative
  zero, ROLL with repeated values, a taproot key that is not on the curve,
  and LOW_S, STRICTENC and NULLFAIL alone): `script_tests` 1280/1280,
  `tx_valid` 122/122, `tx_invalid` 97/97. The harness now passes each flag
  as written, so the LOW_S rows check that the interpreter itself requires
  strict DER, and a CONST_SCRIPTCODE row without WITNESS reaches the
  interpreter. A target dir staged at the old pin picks up the new JSON.
  Official `bitcoind` binaries and the release check stay on v32.1. The
  5 new functional scripts are inventory skips. Nine run-set scripts are
  skips until master's new checks pass: reply order before a pong
  (#1483), insufficient-work outbound disconnect (#1484), exclusive P2P
  bind (#1485), `submitpackage` `other-wtxid` (#1486), and orphan
  requests after a rejected parent (#1487), and the custom-signet datadir
  name (#1488). The functional shim now reads
  `whitelist=` from `bitcoin.conf` (#1476).
