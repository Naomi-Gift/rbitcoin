Fixed

- **A poisoned confirm-feed wait returns the guard.** The lookup thread stays up. The success arm is still `wait_timeout`'s guard.
- **A missing queued `tx.head` batch drains as empty.** `Some` still submits that same vec.
- **An empty io_uring free-slot list stops the fill.** A g-page completion with no slot still poisons the session. The page buffer and the pread count are unchanged.
- **A panicked tx-admit or Electrum blocking task resumes that payload.** Cancel still aborts the caller. `Ok` is still that result. The Electrum connection still maps a dead dispatch task to an I/O error.
