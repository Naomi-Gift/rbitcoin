Added

- **`--sp-tweaks` can run beside `--prune-seqsigwit`.** Turn it on before
  taproot, or later once every height from that origin through the dropped
  range is sealed or still in the last 288 blocks. Prune can be turned on
  after the index is built when the index covers every height the cut will
  drop. Sealed rows keep being served from the index.

Fixed

- A pruned `blockchain.tweaks.subscribe` reads an unsealed tip from the keep
  window. A confirm batch does not delete a witness until that height's tweak
  row is sealed, and only through the tip whose flush has landed. A crash
  that cut the witness stem before saving the prune height is treated as
  those heights already dropped.
