Fixed

- **IBD no longer connects a block that re-spends a same-block spend after
  a rejected write.** When IBD merged two load batches into one write and
  that write rejected a block that spent an output a lower block in the
  write had already spent in its own block, the one-block retry connected
  the bad block. The output then read as unspent everywhere (`gettxout`,
  Electrum, Esplora, mempool admission). The archive's spent slot for an
  output spent inside the write now names the first spender in chain
  order, not whichever map entry came last. A store that already
  connected such a block keeps the wrong slot; re-sync it.
