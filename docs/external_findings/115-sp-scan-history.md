# 115 — Silent-payment scan dropped history older than 256 blocks

**Severity:** medium
**Status:** fixed
**Found by:** Sparrow against a deployed v0.9.2, 2026-11-13

Follows [065](./065-sp-scan-window.md). That finding had two parts: a
silent-payment scan with a nonzero start walked to the tip in one piece,
and it kept running after the client disconnected. Its fix kept every scan
inside the last 256 heights.

The window bounded the work by dropping the request. Sparrow restores a
wallet from its birthday. The start came back moved up to the tip minus
256, and a payment below that was never scanned. A start sent as a Unix
time, which is what Sparrow sends, was refused with `timestamp start not
supported`.

**Fix:** the scan starts where the client asked. A start above 500,000,000
is a Unix time and resolves to the last block whose header time is at
least two hours before it. What 065 guarded against is bounded another
way:

- A scan holds one of three process-wide permits for at most 256 heights,
  then releases it. Scans waiting for a permit take turns.
- The scan runs beside the session. It stops before its next chunk when
  the connection ends, when the client unsubscribes, or when a new
  subscribe replaces it. A connection has one scan.
- The scan reads one chunk ahead of what the client has taken and no
  further.

What is not bounded: a connected client may ask for the whole chain, and
the node scans it for as long as that client stays connected. That is the
request a restoring wallet makes.

The 065 regression `sp_scan_stops_when_the_client_hangs_up` is replaced by
`sp_scan_stops_when_the_session_drops_it`. The window asserts in
`parse_sub_labels_start_and_networks` now assert the requested start.
